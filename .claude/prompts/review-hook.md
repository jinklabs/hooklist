# Hooklist — PR Review Instructions

You are reviewing a PR that adds or modifies a Uniswap v4 hook file. Your job is to verify the hook metadata is correct by fetching the on-chain source code and cross-referencing it.

## Step 1: Identify Changed Hook Files

Find which `hooks/<chain>/<address>.json` files were added or modified in this PR.

## Step 2: For Each Hook File

### 2a: Verify the Address Flags

Decode the lowest 14 bits of the hook address and confirm the `flags` section matches. The `validate.yml` workflow already checks this, but confirm it in your review.

| Bit | Flag |
|-----|------|
| 13 | beforeInitialize |
| 12 | afterInitialize |
| 11 | beforeAddLiquidity |
| 10 | afterAddLiquidity |
| 9 | beforeRemoveLiquidity |
| 8 | afterRemoveLiquidity |
| 7 | beforeSwap |
| 6 | afterSwap |
| 5 | beforeDonate |
| 4 | afterDonate |
| 3 | beforeSwapReturnsDelta |
| 2 | afterSwapReturnsDelta |
| 1 | afterAddLiquidityReturnsDelta |
| 0 | afterRemoveLiquidityReturnsDelta |

### 2b: Fetch and Analyze Source Code

Look up the chain in `chains.json` to get the `chainId`. Fetch verified source:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.etherscan.io/v2/api?chainid=CHAIN_ID&module=contract&action=getsourcecode&address=ADDRESS&apikey=$ETHERSCAN_API_KEY" -o etherscan_response.json
```

For Blockscout chains (zora, ink, soneium) and Routescan chains (avalanche), use the `explorerUrl` from `chains.json` instead (no API key needed).

Parse the response:
```bash
python3 scripts/parse_etherscan.py etherscan_response.json
```

Then use `Grep` to search `.sources/` for relevant patterns.

### 2c: Verify Properties

Cross-reference the `properties` section against the source code:

1. **dynamicFee**: Should be `true` if `beforeSwap` returns a fee override via `lpFeeOverride`, or if the hook calls `poolManager.updateDynamicLPFee()`.

2. **upgradeable**: Should be `true` if the contract uses proxy patterns, `delegatecall`, mutable implementation storage, or `SELFDESTRUCT`.

3. **requiresCustomSwapData**: Should be `true` if a normal swap with empty `hookData` would **fail, revert, or produce materially incorrect behavior** — i.e. the hook requires specific encoded data (signatures, parameters, routing info, etc.) to function. Should be `false` if swaps work correctly without `hookData`, even if the hook optionally inspects it for ancillary features (e.g. an optional trade referrer).

4. **vanillaSwap**: Verify this answers: "Once a swap is allowed to execute, does it behave identically to a standard v4 pool?"

   **Must be `false` if ANY of:** `dynamicFee` is true, `requiresCustomSwapData` is true, `beforeSwapReturnsDelta` or `afterSwapReturnsDelta` is true, the hook executes nested swaps or transfers tokens inside beforeSwap/afterSwap, or the hook modifies pool state that changes swap behavior.

   **Must be `true` if:** the hook has no swap flags at all.

   **Can be `true` if:** the hook has beforeSwap/afterSwap but they only perform access control (revert-based gating), observation (recording prices/ticks/volumes), or event emission — without modifying how the swap executes.

   A hook that *blocks* swaps (reverts) is vanilla. A hook that *changes* how swaps execute is not.

5. **swapAccess**: Verify the classification matches the actual access control mechanism in beforeSwap:
   - `"none"` — beforeSwap has no access control, or the hook has no swap flags
   - `"temporal"` — gates on `block.timestamp` or `block.number` (configurable start/end times)
   - `"allowlist"` — checks caller against an approved address set, registry, or Merkle proof
   - `"governance"` — checks a boolean flag (e.g., `migrated`, `tradingEnabled`) set by an owner/admin
   - `"other"` — any other gating mechanism

   These are orthogonal to `vanillaSwap` — a hook can be vanilla with restricted access.

### 2d: Check Metadata

- `verifiedSource` should be `true` if Etherscan has verified source code
- `chainId` should match the chain in `chains.json`
- `name` should be one of: `ContractName` from Etherscan, a recognizable abbreviation of it, or a project-qualified label substantiated by the source (NatSpec `@title`, file path, imports). It must **not** contain promotional, audit, safety, affiliation, or endorsement language (e.g. "Official", "Verified", "Audited", "Safe", "Trusted", brand names not present in the source) unless those terms are explicit in the verified source itself. If you see such language, REQUEST_CHANGES — the analyze-hook step should have rejected the submitter's suggestion.
- `description` must factually describe what the source actually does. Every claim should be substantiated by the Solidity logic. Reject descriptions that contain audit claims, safety guarantees, affiliations, or marketing language not present in the source.

## Step 3: Output Your Review

Provide your findings as structured JSON. The workflow will post the review for you.

- If everything checks out, set `outcome` to `"APPROVE"` and summarize your verification in `review_body`.
- If there are issues, set `outcome` to `"REQUEST_CHANGES"` and explain in `review_body` what's wrong and what the correct values should be.
